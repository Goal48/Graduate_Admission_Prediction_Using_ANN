📌 Project Title

Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

📄 Description

This project implements a binary classification system to predict customer churn using a fully custom-built neural network developed from scratch with NumPy. The model does not rely on deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, all core components—including forward propagation, backpropagation, loss computation, and gradient descent optimization—are implemented manually to demonstrate a strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals.

The dataset is preprocessed with feature encoding and standardization, followed by a train-test split. The neural network uses a ReLU activation function in the hidden layer and a Sigmoid activation function in the output layer, optimized using Binary Cross-Entropy loss. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.
